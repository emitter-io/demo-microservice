docker-nginx
============

A high-performance Nginx base image for Docker to serve static websites. It will serve anything in the `/var/www` directory.

To build a Docker image for your site, you'll need to create a `Dockerfile`. For example, if your site is in a directory called `src/`, you could create this `Dockerfile`:

    FROM kyma/docker-nginx
    COPY src/ /var/www
    CMD 'nginx'

Then build and run it:

    $ docker build -t mysite .
    ...
    Successfully built 5ae2fb5cf4f8
    $ docker run -p 80:80 -d mysite
    da809981545f
    $ curl localhost
    ...
